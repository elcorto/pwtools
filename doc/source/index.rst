Welcome to the pwtools documentation
====================================

``pwtools`` is a Python package for pre- and postprocessing of atomic
calculations, mostly targeted to `Quantum Espresso <QE_>`_, CPMD_, CP2K_ and
LAMMPS_. It is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike ASE_, with some tools
extending numpy_/scipy_. It has a set of powerful parsers and data types for
storing calculation data. See the :ref:`feature overview <overview>` for more.
