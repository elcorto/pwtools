Velocity autocorrelation function and phonon DOS
================================================

Correlation and power spectrum
------------------------------
Here are some (textbook) notes about correlation, which you should read in
order to understand how the phonon DOS (= vibrational density of states =
power spectrum of the atomic velocities) is calculated in pwtools (see
:mod:`~pwtools.pydos`).

The cross-correlation theorem for the two-sided correlation::

  corr(a,b) = ifft(fft(a)*fft(b).conj())

If a == b, then this reduces to the special case of the Wiener-Khinchin theorem
(autocorrelation of `a`)::

  corr(a,a) = ifft(abs(fft(a))**2)

where the power spectrum of `a` is simply::

    fft(corr(a,a)) == abs(fft(a))**2

Both theorems assume *periodic* data, i.e. `a` and `b` repeat after `nstep`
points. To deal with non-periodic data, we use zero-padding with ``nstep-1``
points at the end of `a` before ``fft``. Therefore, the correlated signal is
``2*nstep-1`` points long ("two-sided correlation") and contains the correlations for positive and
negative lags. Since the autocorrelation function is symmetric around lag=0, we
return 0 ... +lag in :func:`pwtools.signal.acorr`. To compare that with
``scipy.signal.correlate(a,a,'full')``, we need to mirror the result at lag=0
again.

Here are these equalities with discrete data. Note that due to the
way in which fft/ifft packs the data in the returned array, we need
to do some slicing + mirror tricks to get it right. In each example,
the arrays c1,c2,c3 and p1,p2 are the same and for ``corr(v,v)`` we use
``acorr(v)`` here.

Two-sided correlation for -lag...0...+lag::

    >>> from pwtools.signal import pad_zeros, welch, mirror, acorr
    >>> from scipy.signal import correlate
    >>> from scipy.fftpack import fft,ifft
    >>> pad=lambda x: pad_zeros(x, nadd=len(x)-1)
    >>> n=500; w=welch(n)
    >>> t=linspace(0,1,n); dt=t[1]-t[0]
    >>> v=np.array([sin(2*pi*f*t + rand()*2*pi) for f in rand(10)*100]).sum(0)
    >>> f=np.fft.fftfreq(2*n-1, dt)[:n]
    >>> figure(); plot(t,v); title('signal')

    >>> c1=mirror(ifft(abs(fft(pad(v)))**2.0)[:n].real)
    >>> c2=correlate(v,v,'full')
    >>> c3=mirror(acorr(v,norm=False))
    >>> figure(); plot(c1, label='fft'); plot(c2, label='scipy'); \
    ... plot(c3, label='acorr'); title('corr'); legend()

and the power spectra as ``fft(corr(v,v))``, now one-sided::

    >>> p1=(abs(fft(pad(v)))**2.0)[:n]
    >>> p2=(abs(fft(mirror(acorr(v,norm=False)))))[:n]
    >>> figure(); plot(f,p1, label='fft'); plot(f,p2, label='acorr'); \
    ... title('spectrum'); legend()

also with a Welch window::

    >>> p1=(abs(fft(pad(v*w)))**2.0)[:n]
    >>> p2=(abs(fft(mirror(acorr(v*w,norm=False)))))[:n]
    >>> figure(); plot(f,p1, label='fft'); plot(f,p2, label='acorr'); \
    ... title('spectrum welch'); legend()

The zero-padding before ``fft`` is manadatory! It is also done inside
:func:`scipy.signal.correlate()`.

The 1D reference implementation is :func:`pwtools.signal.acorr`, which contains the
fft-based correlation (Wiener-Khinchin) along with other methods.

Padding and smoothing
---------------------

There is `another code <tfreq_>`_ out there (appart from ``fourier.x`` from CPMD)
which calculates the phonon DOS from MD data. What they do is padding the
`correlation` function, i.e. something like ``fft(pad(acorr(v)))``, which is
`not` the same as ``fft(mirror(acorr(v)))``. They also use smoothing (convolution
with a gaussian, i.e. ``fft(smooth(pad(acorr(v))))``) after padding, which is
less effective than using a Welch (or any other) window function. But we
haven't tested the code, so all this may work just fine.

For smoothing the spectrum (e.g. ``p1=(abs(fft(pad(v)))**2.0)[:n]``) using our
implementation, use :func:`pwtools.signal.smooth`, i.e. ``smooth(p1)``. For
increasing the interpolation, use more padding `of the time series`, for
instance ``pad_zeros(v, nadd=(len(v)-1)*5)`` instead of `len(v)-1`.


Calculation of the phonon DOS from MD data
------------------------------------------

The :mod:`~pwtools.pydos` module containes many helper and reference
implementations, but the the main function to be used is
:func:`~pwtools.pydos.pdos`.

There are two ways of computing the phonon density of states (PDOS) from an MD
trajectory. ``v`` is the 3d array of atomic velocities with shape (nstep,natoms,3),
i.e. ``Trajectory.velocity``, see :func:`~pwtools.crys.velocity_traj`.

* ``method='vacf'``: ``fft`` of the velocity autocorrelation function (``vacf``):
    ``v`` -> ``vacf`` -> ``fft(vacf)`` = PDOS, see :func:`~pwtools.pydos.vacf_pdos`
* ``method='direct'``:  ``abs(fft(v))**2`` = PDOS, see :func:`~pwtools.pydos.direct_pdos`,
    This is much faster and mathematically exactly the same, see
    ``examples/examples/phonon_dos`` and ``test/test_pdos.py`` .

Both methods are implemented but actually only method 'direct' is worth using.
Method 'vacf' still exists for historical reasons and as reference.

The actual implementation is in :func:`~pwtools.pydos.pdos` and the above two
functions are convenience wrappers.

* In method 'vacf', if we mirror the ``vacf`` at t=0 before the ``fft``, then we get
  double frequency resolution.

* By default, :func:`~pwtools.pydos.direct_pdos` uses zero-padding of ``v`` to
  get the same frequency resolution as we would get with mirroring the signal
  (``mirr=True``) :func:`~pwtools.pydos.vacf_pdos`. Also, padding is necessary
  b/c of the arguments outlined above for the 1d case.

* Both methods use Welch windowing by default to reduce "leakage" from
  neighboring peaks.

* Both methods must produce exactly the same results (up to numerical noise).

* The frequency axis of the PDOS is in Hz. It is "f", NOT the angular frequency
  2*pi*f. See also ``examples/pdos_methods.py``.

* The difference to the 1d case:
    * mass weighting: this affects only the relative peak `heights` in the
      PDOS, not the peak positions
    * averaging over `natoms` to get a 1d array (time series)
